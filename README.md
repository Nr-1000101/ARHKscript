# ARHKscript

A small tool I created in my free time to help with the tedious tasks in ARK.

IMPORTANT! Most functions will only work for 1920 1080 resolution. To make it work for other resolutions you will have to check and swap coordinates manually.

Also for some reason ARK only accepts clicks if you run the script with admin privileges.

Showcase and a mini tutorial how to adjust it to fit your needs here: https://youtu.be/FRi8UhBEr88

Enjoy.
